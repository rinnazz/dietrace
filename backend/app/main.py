"""
main.py — FastAPI application entrypoint.

Wires together the database health check, CORS, and routers. Right now
only the auth router is included since that's all that's built.

HANDOFF NOTE FOR WHOEVER PICKS THIS UP NEXT:
Add the patient / menu / recommendation / dashboard routers below using the
exact same pattern as auth_router — import it, then app.include_router(...).
The expert system itself (rules.py, inference_engine.py, explanation.py)
plugs into the recommendation router's POST /recommendations/generate/{id}
endpoint — see SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT_BLUEPRINT.md Section 7 and Section 16.

STARTUP PASSWORD FIX (see _fix_unhashed_dietitian_passwords below):
Some dietitian rows were inserted with a plaintext password sitting in
password_hash instead of a real bcrypt hash. This runs once per server
start, fixes any row that isn't a real bcrypt hash yet, and is a no-op on
every run after the first. Convenience over correctness — fine for a
5-row prototype, would not do this in a real production app (that's what
a proper migration script is for).
